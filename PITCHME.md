# Router in Computer Networks

---

## What is a Router?

- A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks
- It operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model
- Routers are the backbone of the internet, connecting different networks and enabling global communication

## History of Routers

- 1969: The first router-like device was created for ARPANET
- 1970s: Early routers were called "gateways"
- 1980s: The term "router" became popular
- 1980: Stanford University developed the "Blue Box" router
- 1981: William Yeager created the first multi-protocol router
- 1984: Cisco Systems was founded, becoming a major router manufacturer

## Characteristics of Routers

- Intelligent packet forwarding
- Network address translation (NAT)
- Firewall capabilities
- Quality of Service (QoS) management
- Support for multiple network protocols
- Scalability and modularity
- Remote management and configuration

## Router Architecture

1. Input Ports
2. Switching Fabric
3. Output Ports
4. Routing Processor
5. Memory (RAM, NVRAM, Flash)
6. Operating System (e.g., Cisco IOS, Juniper Junos)

## Working Principle

1. Packet Reception: Router receives data packets on input ports
2. Header Examination: Extracts destination IP address from packet header
3. Routing Table Lookup: Consults routing table to determine best path
4. Forwarding Decision: Selects appropriate output port
5. Packet Transmission: Sends packet out through the chosen port

---

## Router Protocols

- Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
- Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)

---

## Future of Routers

- Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
- 5G and beyond network infrastructure
- AI and Machine Learning integration
- Increased security features
- Higher speeds and lower latency
